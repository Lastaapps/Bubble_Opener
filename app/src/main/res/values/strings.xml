This is important! Read the full article, please.
\n\n
When you click the „Click me“ button, a notification will be posted. Click on the „Show as bubble“ symbol.
You can also place a shortcut to your home screen.
\n\n
When a bubble is shown, you can click PLUS symbol and choose whatever contact system shows.
\n\n
If there is NO PLUS symbol next to the bubble, this app is useless for you and you can uninstall it.
It is caused by some Android vendors wrongly implementing the bubbles API from Google,
it is not fault of this app so please don\'t leave bad reviews on Play Store. Have a nice day.
